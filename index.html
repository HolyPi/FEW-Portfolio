<strong><p>About me:</p></strong>
<p>I was born in Puerto Rico and love Videogames. I lived in <abbr title=â€œPuerto Rico">PR</abbr>  16 years, but had to move to New York.<br>
    In New York I took a computer science class which made my interest in technology bigger, and now I want to know as much as there is to it.
